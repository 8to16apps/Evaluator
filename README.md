# Evaluator
Simple addon to __Godot Engine__ to make mathematic calculations into the editor. You can use all the mathematic funcions of __GDScript__.

## How it works
The core of the evaluator is a run-time simple __GDScript__ function whitch evaluate the string you enter in the tool as __GDScript__ code.

I hope will be useful for the __Godot Engine__ community, as tool or as learning resource.
